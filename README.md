This app was my first app utilizing django as a back end and react as a front end. First the user enters a topic. Then 
I take a stream of tweets, geo locate them, analyze their sentiment, and then send them to my react front end to server 
them on a map.
<br>
Green is positive
<br>
White is neutral
<br>
Red is negative
<br>
I learned about:
<br>
    Connecting a front end interface with a back end api.
<br>
    Callback functions.
<br>
    Dealing with API rate limits
<br>
    Transfering what I've learned in rails to new frameworks
<br>
    Managing my learning goals with projects goals
<br>
    Combining libraries to do interesting information.
