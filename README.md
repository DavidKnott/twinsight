To run this app you will need a:
<br>
1.auth0 account
2.twitter developer account
3.mapbox developer account
<br>
This app was my first app utilizing django as a back end and react as a front end.  First the user enters a topic.
Then I take a stream of tweets, geo locate them, analyze their sentiment, and then send them to my react front end to 
server them on a map.
<br>Green is positive
<br>White is neutral
<br>Red is negative
<br>
I learned about:
<br>
  1. Connecting a front end interface with a back end api.
  2. Callback functions.
  3. Dealing with API rate limits
  4. Transfering what I've learned in rails to new frameworks
  5. Managing my learning goals with projects goals
  7. Combining libraries to do interesting information.
